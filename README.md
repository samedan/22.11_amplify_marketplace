https://github.com/samedan/22.11_amplify_marketplace

# Initial Git 2021 amplifyagora

https://github.com/samedan/amplifyagora
https://github.com/samedan/2110_aws_marketplace

## Getting started

> Old Tranformer Graphql version
> amplify/cli.json
> "transformerversion": 1,
> "useexperimentalpipelinedtransformer": false,
> Old NodeJS (< version 17)

## Create a .env file in /amplify/backend/function/orderlambda/src
.env
## Create a aws-exports.js file in /src
aws-exports.js

## Still to fix
> route to Profile page on every page
> MARKET/PRODUCTS OWNER works only on reload
